# Quantitative-Value-Strategy

This Python code scraps data from Yahoo Finance of 5100+ stocks listed on NASDAQ to design a program for optimal investment strategy.
It uses a quantitative value strategy of searching for undervalued businesses that are expected to increase in value over time. For this, a robust value measure based on key fundamental value metrics (P/E, P/S, P/B, EV/EBITDA etc.) is calculated. Then based on user preference for the size of portfolio and number of stocks to invest in, the programme finds an efficient allocation of financial portfolio using the above key value metrics based on live prices.
